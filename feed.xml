The name of this algorithm comes from the ostrich effect, which is a cognitive bias where people avoid negative information by pretending it does not exist or hiding from it.</p> <p>This algorithm is commonly used in operating systems, where ignoring rare problems can be the most efficient way to handle them. For example, in a multiprocessor algorithm, if it reaches a deadlock but the condition to reach the deadlock is exceedingly rare, and the probability suggests that it happens only once in a decade, then that problem can be ignored.</p> <p>The Ostrich Algorithm is a simple yet powerful concept that can help software engineers optimize their systems. By ignoring extremely rare problems, they can focus on more pressing issues and increase the overall efficiency of their algorithms. However, it is important to use this algorithm judiciously, as ignoring too many problems can lead to serious issues down the line.</p> <p>In conclusion, the Ostrich Algorithm is a useful tool for software engineers that can help them prioritize and optimize their work. By understanding when to ignore rare problems, they can improve the efficiency of their algorithms and avoid unnecessary headaches in the future.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="random"/><category term="random"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just an article about small random articles that I read, but don't deserve a blog post on their own]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Building my own mechanical keyboard</title><link href="https://rvk7895.github.io/blog/2023/building-my-own-mechanical-keyboard/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Building my own mechanical keyboard"/><published>2023-07-04T15:12:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-07-04T15:12:00+00:00</updated><id>https://rvk7895.github.io/blog/2023/building-my-own-mechanical-keyboard</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://rvk7895.github.io/blog/2023/building-my-own-mechanical-keyboard/"><![CDATA[<h1 id="bought-the-monsgeek-m1w-pre-built-waiting-for-it-to-deliever">BOUGHT THE MONSGEEK M1W PRE-BUILT. WAITING FOR IT TO DELIEVER</h1> <h2 id="decided-the-keyboard">Decided the keyboard</h2> <p>So, I think I’ve decided the components that I would be going for to build my keyboard.</p> <p>Base - <strong>Zuoya LMK81.</strong> I had been surfing r/mkindia when I saw the independence day sale for keyboards on <a href="http://stickeys.in">stickeys.in</a>, a vendor I had not been aware of. And well browsing there I found</p> <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2> <p>I’ve wanted to build a custom mechanical keyboard for a while now. It all started when I stumbled upon my first MK in one of my college senior’s rooms (Sorry, I don’t remember your name but thank you for introducing me to MKs &lt;3; you probably resided on the ground floor of Bakul Niwas in IIIT Hyderabad in 2019).</p> <p>Let me tell you, there is nothing like typing on a mechanical keyboard. The sound it makes is so satisfying, and the feeling is just a <em>chef’s kiss</em>. I find myself typing away on it for hours on end to feel that sensation. It’s like a mini dopamine hit every time I press a key.</p> <p>I had always been putting it off until the day I would receive a big paycheck, and well, the day has finally arrived. I should’ve planned for it, but for some reason, I had always been delaying that, but today somehow, I’ve got the motivation to build one, so yeah.</p> <p>But it’s not like that; I’d not thought about it; I do randomly watch youtube videos on mechanical keyboards and occasionally use some of my friend’s MKs, so I do have a clue of what I want to build. So here’s what I have in mind -</p> <ol> <li>A 65% layout. Just cause I don’t feel like having a big keyboard, but I do need the arrow keys, which 60% layout does not have.</li> <li>I will definitely be going for Cherry MX brown switches. I love the blues cause of the sound (yeah, I love to annoy people with that tat tat tat clicking noise 😈).</li> <li>Obviously would be going for a Hot Swappable PCB board cause I don’t want to solder my switches. (It might save money, but too much hassle and I’m scared of soldering and messing shit up). Also need to have the option to swap out my switches.</li> <li>DEFINITELY NEEDS TO BE RGB.</li> <li>My budget is 10-15k. I have no idea how much building a custom mechanical keyboard would cost. This budget is based on the cost of Ducky’s 65% keyboards.</li> <li>I don’t want a standard keyboard. Need to have some wow factor about it.</li> </ol> <p>I know a couple of resources that I’m referring to for building my keyboard. I’ll list them down below in case anyone else is interested.</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBon6WwkdJE&amp;ab_channel=LinusTechTips">Build your own Mechanical Keyboard… the RIGHT Way - YouTube</a> - Linus Tech Tips (Its LTT.

Here I would be adding notes of the items that I think are relevant could be helpful to me in future and might to others also.</p> <h2 id="builders">Builders</h2> <p>When the class has a lot of optional parameters, one should consider using Builder. Builders allow you the flexibility which Static Factories and Constructors don’t for optional parameters.</p> <p>Traditionally the design pattern of <strong><a href="https://www.captaindebug.com/2011/05/telescoping-constructor-antipattern#:~:text=The%20Telescoping%20Constructor%20is%20an,there%20are%20better%20alternatives%20availble.">telescoping constructor</a></strong> was used in case of optional parameters. But that makes you write a lot of redundant code, which later can become unreadable with many methods of the same name.</p> <p>Another method which can be used to tackle the problem of optional parameters is that of using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setter</code> methods. Here we can use a constructor to just create an object and then use the setter methods to assign attributes to that object. Something like</p> <div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">Test</span> <span class="o">{</span>

</code></pre></div></div> <p>Using this pattern, instead of making the object directly, the client calls a constructor with all of the required parameters and gets a builder object. Using this builder object, we get access to setter methods which returns the same builder object but after setting some parameters of the object for which the setter method was invoked. Then finally the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">build</code> methods is called which returns the desired class’s object.</p> <p>This is a substitute for the named optional parameters in Python and Scala.</p> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Builder</code> functionality is also well suite to class hierarchies. I’ll come back to this when I have covered <em>recursive type parameter</em> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clone()</code></p> <p>References:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://www.captaindebug.com/2011/05/telescoping-constructor-antipattern#:~:text=The%20Telescoping%20Constructor%20is%20an,there%20are%20better%20alternatives%20availble.">Captain Debug’s Blog: The Telescoping Constructor (Anti)Pattern</a></li> </ul> <h2 id="static-factory-methods">Static Factory Methods</h2> <p>Static factory methods in Java are basically like constructors but carry a meaningful name to them. They are static methods that return an instance of the native class. These methods can come in handy when you need to have multiple constructors that return the object but with some form of different configuration.</p> <aside> 💡 In case you forgot, `static` methods don’t need an object of a class to be called. Thus these static factory methods come in handy. </aside> <p>These methods have the following advantages over constructors -</p> <ol> <li>Static Factory methods allow reuse of already created instances or use cached instances of a class, instead of creating new ones. This can lead to improve in performances. An example of this is is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Boolean.valueOf(boolean var)</code></li> <li>It can also return an object of the subtype thus giving you more flexibility over choice of the class of the object returned. This also allows to return object of classes without making those classes public.</li> <li>As I had mentioned earlier, another advantage is that object can vary from call to call as function of the input parameters. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Enum</code> class makes use of this advantage and thus does not have any public constructors.</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="coding,"/><category term="java"/><category term="coding,"/><category term="java"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Notes of the book that I was suggested while interning in Sprinklr]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Good Coding Practices</title><link href="https://rvk7895.github.io/blog/2023/good-coding-practices/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Good Coding Practices"/><published>2023-06-23T15:12:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-06-23T15:12:00+00:00</updated><id>https://rvk7895.github.io/blog/2023/good-coding-practices</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://rvk7895.github.io/blog/2023/good-coding-practices/"><![CDATA[<h1 id="write-better-log-statements">Write better log statements</h1> <p>As a developer, you might assume that adding logging statements is an easy job. After all, what’s there to it? Just write a simple <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">print</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">System.out.println()</code> statement, and you’re done, right? (Although, let’s be real, Java, what’s up with that unnecessarily long syntax?)</p> <p>However, the reality is that logging is one of the most essential tools for debugging your code. Without proper logging, you can’t easily track down bugs, troubleshoot issues, or understand how your code is behaving in different environments. And if you’re not writing descriptive log statements that are easily understood by other developers, then it’s as good as a knitted condom - it might look good, but it’s not going to be helpful when you really need it.</p> <p>So, how can you write better log statements? How can you make sure that your logging is effective and helpful for you, your team, and any other developers who might need to work with your code? Here are some tips to consider:</p> <ul> <li>Use meaningful log messages that provide information about the context in which the log message is being generated. This can include details like the function or method where the log message is being generated, the values of any relevant variables, and any other contextual information that might be helpful for understanding what’s happening.</li> <li>Use log levels appropriately to indicate the severity of the log message. For example, you might use a “debug” log level for messages that are only relevant for developers, and a “warning” log level for messages that indicate potential issues that should be addressed.</li> <li>Avoid using hard-coded strings in log messages. Instead, use constants or variables to make log messages more maintainable and easier to read. This can help ensure that all your log messages are consistent and use the same terminology, which can be especially helpful when you’re dealing with a complex codebase.</li> <li>Be consistent in your log message format and structure. This can include details like the order of the message components, the use of whitespace and line breaks, and any other formatting details that can help make your log messages more readable and consistent.</li> <li>Include relevant information such as the timestamp, thread ID, and relevant metadata. This can help you track down issues and understand how your code is behaving in different environments.</li> <li>Use log aggregation tools such as Logstash, Fluentd, or Splunk to centralize and analyze your logs. These tools can help you easily search through your logs, identify patterns or trends, and troubleshoot issues more quickly and effectively.</li> </ul> <p>By following these tips, you can improve your logging and make it more effective for your team and your codebase. So, don’t skimp on your logging - take the time to write clear, concise, and helpful log messages that will make your life easier in the long run.</p> <hr/> <h1 id="close-your-goddamn-resources">Close your goddamn resources</h1> <p>One of the most common reasons on why builds in production fail is because of improper usage of the resources. A typical application nowadays would deal will deal with a lot of resources like <strong>Files, Sockets and Database Connections</strong>. These resources need to be handled with a lot of care, because an operating system allocates the application system resources, and typically systems have an upper limit on this. If for some reason the program fails or an exception occurs and the resources aren’t freed up, it keeps on building up, and this leads to application servers being frequently restarted when resource exhaustion occurs.</p> <p>For any resources that has been opened, a corresponding call to its <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">close()</code> method should be made. Also effective use of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">try/catch/finally</code> is needed when dealing with outside resources, to make sure that any execution path leads to proper closing of the resources also.</p> <p>Many programming languages like Python and Ruby provide language level facilities which allow automatic handling of resources. In Java also a programming construct known as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">try-with-resource</code> allows an effective way for automatic handling of resources. The syntax for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">try-with-resource</code> is as follows:</p> <div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">try</span><span class="o">(</span>
			<span class="c1">//Resource 1 Declaration;</span>
			<span class="c1">// .</span>
