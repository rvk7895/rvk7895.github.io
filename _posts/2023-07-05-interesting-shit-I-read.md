## The Ostrich Algorithm: A Strategy in Computer Science

The Ostrich Algorithm is a strategy in computer science that suggests ignoring problems that are exceedingly rare. The name of this algorithm comes from the ostrich effect, which is a cognitive bias where people avoid negative information by pretending it does not exist or hiding from it.

This algorithm is commonly used in operating systems, where ignoring rare problems can be the most efficient way to handle them. For example, in a multiprocessor algorithm, if it reaches a deadlock but the condition to reach the deadlock is exceedingly rare, and the probability suggests that it happens only once in a decade, then that problem can be ignored.

The Ostrich Algorithm is a simple yet powerful concept that can help software engineers optimize their systems. By ignoring extremely rare problems, they can focus on more pressing issues and increase the overall efficiency of their algorithms. However, it is important to use this algorithm judiciously, as ignoring too many problems can lead to serious issues down the line.

In conclusion, the Ostrich Algorithm is a useful tool for software engineers that can help them prioritize and optimize their work. By understanding when to ignore rare problems, they can improve the efficiency of their algorithms and avoid unnecessary headaches in the future.
