# BOUGHT THE MONSGEEK M1W PRE-BUILT. WAITING FOR IT TO DELIEVER

## Decided the keyboard

So, I think Iâ€™ve decided the components that I would be going for to build my keyboard.

Base - **Zuoya LMK81.** I had been surfing r/mkindia when I saw the independence day sale for keyboards on [stickeys.in](http://stickeys.in), a vendor I had not been aware of. And well browsing there I found 

## Introduction

I've wanted to build a custom mechanical keyboard for a while now. It all started when I stumbled upon my first MK in one of my college seniorâ€™s rooms (Sorry, I donâ€™t remember your name but thank you for introducing me to MKs <3; you probably resided on the ground floor of Bakul Niwas in IIIT Hyderabad in 2019).

Let me tell you, there is nothing like typing on a mechanical keyboard. The sound it makes is so satisfying, and the feeling is just a *chef's kiss*. I find myself typing away on it for hours on end to feel that sensation. It's like a mini dopamine hit every time I press a key.

I had always been putting it off until the day I would receive a big paycheck, and well, the day has finally arrived. I shouldâ€™ve planned for it, but for some reason, I had always been delaying that, but today somehow, Iâ€™ve got the motivation to build one, so yeah. 

But it's not like that; Iâ€™d not thought about it; I do randomly watch youtube videos on mechanical keyboards and occasionally use some of my friendâ€™s MKs, so I do have a clue of what I want to build. So hereâ€™s what I have in mind -

1. A 65% layout. Just cause I donâ€™t feel like having a big keyboard, but I do need the arrow keys, which 60% layout does not have.
2. I will definitely be going for Cherry MX brown switches. I love the blues cause of the sound (yeah, I love to annoy people with that tat tat tat clicking noise ðŸ˜ˆ). 
3. Obviously would be going for a Hot Swappable PCB board cause I donâ€™t want to solder my switches. (It might save money, but too much hassle and Iâ€™m scared of soldering and messing shit up). Also need to have the option to swap out my switches.
4. DEFINITELY NEEDS TO BE RGB.
5. My budget is 10-15k. I have no idea how much building a custom mechanical keyboard would cost. This budget is based on the cost of Duckyâ€™s 65% keyboards.
6. I donâ€™t want a standard keyboard. Need to have some wow factor about it.

I know a couple of resources that Iâ€™m referring to for building my keyboard. Iâ€™ll list them down below in case anyone else is interested.

### Updates July 6, 2023

So iâ€™ve found out that building a fully custom MK is not that easy of a task (ofcourse why would it be) and being a complete novice in this field, Iâ€™ve a feeling I should be going towards building a macroboard which looks something like this

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/macroboards.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>

Yup sounds underwhelming but this would be an easier route go with, but I havenâ€™t decided that. Iâ€™ll now document what Iâ€™ve learned today about keyboards today.

- So as we all know a keyboard
