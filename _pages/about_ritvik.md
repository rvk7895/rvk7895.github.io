Hi ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m an AI Engineer at Sarvam AI (Bengaluru). I learn, build and break things â€” not always in that order. I care about making AI systems fair, inclusive, and useful in the real world.

My interests sit at the intersection of Humanâ€“Computer Interaction and Responsible/Trustworthy AI, with hands-on work in Generative AI and LLM agents (including NLâ†’SQL and goal-oriented agents).

Previously, I was a Founding Engineer at Pipable AI. I completed a Dual Degree (B.Tech + MS by Research) in Computer Science from IIIT Hyderabad (CGPA 8.29), where my research explored algorithmic fairness in deployed platforms.

When Iâ€™m not shipping models or experiments, youâ€™ll probably find me jamming on my keytar, playing computer/board games, or brewing a good cup of coffee.
