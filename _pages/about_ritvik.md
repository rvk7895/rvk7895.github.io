Hi ðŸ‘‹

I am a ML Engineer at Sarvam AI. I learn, build and break things, definitely not in that order.

I am interested in the field of Human Computer Interaction, more specifically in the domain of Fairness in AI deployed systems. I am also interested in the field of Natural Language Processing, and actively looking into the problem of Natural Language to SQL generation and LLM agents.

Beyond this, you can probably find me jamming on my keytar, playing computer and board games, or just brewing a cup of coffee.
