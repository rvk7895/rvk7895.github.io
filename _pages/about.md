<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hi ðŸ‘‹

I am a ML Engineer at Sarvam AI. I learn, build and break things, definitely not in that order.

I am interested in the field of Human Computer Interaction, more specifically in the domain of Fairness in AI deployed systems. I am also interested in the field of Natural Language Processing, and actively looking into the problem of Natural Language to SQL generation and LLM agents.

Beyond this, you can probably find me jamming on my keytar, playing computer and board games, or just brewing a cup of coffee.
